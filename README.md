# Quinn-Mccloskey-Algorithm
This is an efficient algorithm to get minimized logic expressions of boolean expressions
The algorithm works for any number of variables.

Instructions to use the program:
1-Compile the code
2-Input whether you want to see the test cases included with the program as examples or to input your own boolean expression
3-Input the number of variables in your boolean expression
4-Input your boolean expression in either upper-case or lower-case letters

You'll be provided with the following:
1-The canonical Sop and Pos
2-The truth table
3-Prime implicants
4-Essential prime implicants
5-Minterms not covered by prime implicants
6-Minimized logic expression
